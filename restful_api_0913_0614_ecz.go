// An API app is a special type of Revel application.

// The Greeting action greets the viewer by name.
func (c App) Greeting(name string) revel.Result {

// This example demonstrates how to create a simple RESTful API using Revel.
// It provides two actions: Index and Greeting.
// The Index action simply renders the home page, while the Greeting action
// returns a personalized greeting in JSON format based on the provided name.
// The Greeting action demonstrates how to use Revel's JSON rendering and
// route parameters.
// Be sure to follow Go best practices, such as using clear struct names and
// concise function comments.
// Also, remember to handle errors appropriately and maintain clean code
// that is easy to read and maintain.

// Error handling is demonstrated with Revel's built-in error handling
// mechanisms, such as using the `NotFound` and `Forbidden` methods provided
// by the `Controller` struct.

// To ensure code maintainability and extensibility, it is recommended to
// adhere to the standard Revel project layout, organize code into
// appropriate packages, and make use of Revel's powerful features
// like dependency injection and middleware.
